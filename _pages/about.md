Hello,

I am a sixth-year PhD candidate at Purdue Univeristy-West Lafayette. Currently, I am working with [Prof. Tongcang Li](https://sites.google.com/site/litongcang/){:target="_blank"} and my research interest is focusing on optics, levitated optomechanics, and spin qubits. We build different levitation systems, including metalens (optical), surface ion trap (electric) and magnetic array trap (magnetic, in the future) to investigate levitated spin-optomechanics. 

## Education
