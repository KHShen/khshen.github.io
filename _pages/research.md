Here are some selected projects I have worked during these years.

## On-chip levitation
remember to mention one of 30 breakthroughs of optics and photonics news (OPN) in 2022.

## Surface ion trap
We develop a small and flat chip with lithography to build a surface ion trap. This trap, like common Paul trap, can levitate highly charged nanoparticles.

## NV Spin readout in high vacuum
