Here are some selected projects I have worked during my PhD.

## On-chip levitation
<img src="../../images/metalens.png" width = "70%">

Optical levitation (optical tweezers) in vacuum isolates physical contact to the thermal environment, providing a great platform for studying fundamental physics and performing precision measurements. However, typical optical trapping system requires a bulk objective lens with a high numerical aperture (NA). The object occupies a lot of space, bringing barriers to encapsulate the total setup for practical applications. To solve this issue, we developed a flat and thin metalens with a measured NA of 0.88 to replace the bulk objective. The metalens can optically trap and retain a nanosphere at a pressure of $$2\times 10^{-4}$$ Torr. The metalens is designed with a diameter of 425 $$\mu$$m and a focal length of 100 $$\mu$$m. It is fabricated with amorphous silicon on a sapphire wafer by E-beam lithography. Such a thin and flat lens is able to trap nanoparticles and measure the center-of-mass motion at the same time. In addition, a metalens can also trap a single atom in vacuum for quantum information science.

This work was selected as one of 30 breakthroughs of [optics and photonics news (OPN) in 2022](https://www.optica-opn.org/home/articles/volume_33/december_2022/extras/optical_levitation_with_a_metalens/){:target="_blank"}.

## Spin readout of a levitated diamond in high vacuum
<img src="../../images/surfaceiontrap.png" width = "80%">

Nitrogen-Vacancy in diamond is a spin-1 point defect that is widely studied and serve as quantum sensor for electromagnetic field, temperature, and strain. Combining NV spins with levitated optomechanical resonators will provide a hybrid quantum system for novel applications. Typical methods to levitate a diamond particle in vacuum includes optical-dipole trap (optical tweezers), electric trap (Paul/ion trap), and magnetic trap. Optical levitation uses a strong laser beam to apply the conservative force on the particle, leading to dramatic heating that burns up the diamond particle in high vacuum. Magnetic trap comprises a strong magnetic field that is an inevitable obstacle for spin readout. Only a Paul trap, that makes use of alternative electric force, brings no heating to the levitated diamonds while the electric field has few impact on the quantum energy levels.

We develop a small and flat chip by E-beam lithography to build a surface ion trap. The highly charged (1,000 ~ 10,000 $$e$$) diamond particles are produced by electrospray. They are delivered by another linear ion trap and trapped ~250 $$\mu$$m away from the surface ion trap. NV spins in diamond particles are well-behaved temperature sensors. We measured the instant temperature when pumping down the vacuum chamber by measuring the shift of resonance frequency of the levitated diamond. As the pressure is reduced, the internal temperature of the levitated diamond gradually inscreses. At high vacuum ($$p\le 10^{-4}$$ Torr), the internal temperature stops at around 350 K, which is moderate for further pulse measurement experiments. 

In addition, we drive a levitated diamond to rotate around z axis at a high speed by applying a rotating electric field with the four surrounding electrodes. The dipole moment of the levitated diamond is typically 
2 $$e\cdot\mu$$m. The rotational motion of the levitated diamond is locked to driving electric field. By continuously speeding up the rotation electric field, the levitated diamond can rotate up to 20 MHz ($$1.2\times 10^9$$ rpm). The quantum geometric phase induced by such fast rotation is measured. Our further goal is to create a much faster rotating (GHz) levitated diamond and manipulate the quantum states only by the mechanical rotation.

## Spin qubits in hexgaonal boron nitride

Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a van der Waals material that provides a convenient platform for coupling with nano-photonic structures and creating an integrated device on a chip. In addition, the recently discovered spin defects in hBN are promising for quantum sensing and imaging.
