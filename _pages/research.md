Here are some selected projects I have worked during my PhD.

## On-chip levitation

Optical levitation (optical tweezers) in vacuum isolates physical contact to the thermal environment, providing a great platform for studying fundamental physics and performing precision measurements. However, typical optical trapping system requires a bulk objective lens with a high numerical aperture (NA). The object occupies a lot of space, bringing barriers to encapsulate the total setup for practical applications. To solve this issue, we developed a flat and thin metalens with a measured NA of 0.88 to replace the bulk objective. The metalens can optically trap and retain a nanosphere at a pressure of $$2\times 10^{-4}$$ Torr. The metalens is designed with a diameter of 425 $$\mu$$m and a focal length of 100 $$\mu$$m. It is fabricated with amorphous silicon on a sapphire wafer by E-beam lithography. Such a thin and flat lens is able to trap nanoparticles and measure the center-of-mass motion at the same time. In addition, a metalens can also trap a single atom in vacuum for quantum information science.

This work was selected as one of 30 breakthroughs of [optics and photonics news (OPN) in 2022](https://www.optica-opn.org/home/articles/volume_33/december_2022/extras/optical_levitation_with_a_metalens/){:target="_blank"}.

Nitrogen-Vacancy in diamond 
Typical methods to levitate an object in vacuum includes optical-dipole trap (optical tweezers), electric trap (Paul/ion trap), and magnetic trap.

We develop a small and flat chip with lithography to build a surface ion trap. This trap, like common Paul trap, can levitate highly charged nanoparticles.
